# Week2 Homework2:

### Description:
  - A multipart assignment where we manipulated and passed a list of items. We first used a list view to find the catagories that the items were segmented along. Ad then we bound an onclick listener to the view to allow for the user to click into another segmentation where the original list was partially curated to allow for the user to access only those animals. First it was a simple view, then a ListView with a filter to find that catagories of animals. Then afterwards a new list was rendered from filtering out the catagory the user selected. Then last but not least a detailed view was created when the user tapped on an item with a bound object.
